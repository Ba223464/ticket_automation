Overview 
The Smart Customer Support & Ticket Automation System is a real-time, AI-assisted 
support platform designed to streamline customer–agent interactions and automate

secure web interface, while support agents receive live updates and respond in real time. 
Functional requirements 
● Customer Authentication (Social Sign-In) 
● Ticket Management & Workflow 
○ Customers can create, view, and update support tickets 
○ Ticket lifecycle states: Open, Assigned, In Progress, Waiting on Customer, 
Resolved, Closed 
○ Automatic ticket assignment to available agents 
● Real-Time Ticket Updates (WebSockets) 
○ Live ticket status updates for customers and agents 
○ Real-time agent responses without page refresh 
○ Instant visibility for: New messages, Status changes, Assignment updates 
● Notification System 
○ Email notifications for ticket status changes 
● AI-Assisted Auto-Reply Generation 
○ AI-generated draft responses for agents 
○ Editable drafts before sending 
● Search & Discovery 
○ Full-text search across: 
■ Tickets 
■ Conversation messages 
■ Customer metadata 
○ Filters by status, priority, agent, and date 
● Analytics & Reporting Dashboard 
○ Provides a real-time analytics dashboard to track ticket volume, status 
distribution, and resolution trends.
